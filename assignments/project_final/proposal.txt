CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?

    Student enrollment analysis

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?

    The Arizona department of Education produces a yearly excel file with student enrollment numbers.  
    This files data needs to be cleaned and have some basic data visualization performed for analysis.
    The program will:
        - import the file
        - look at the header row titles (making sure data is consistent with previous years)
        - test each column for data length (prepare to enter into database)
        - count the number of unique school sites
        - check for duplicate school sites
        - do some basic data visualization for data verification



3. What will you learn from developing this program?

The development of this program will help me to learn data automation techniques to improve my work flows.

4. What Python modules will your program use?

    - csv
    - datetime
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - pytest
    - matplotlib
    - math
    - re

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?

    The goal of this program will be to make it as reusable as possible.
    The functions will be single task functions to allow for maximum flexibility.
    I am hoping that lessons learned in this project will allow for expanding these process
    to other data downloads.

6. Will you write test functions to test at least two of your program
functions?

    Test functions will be written to test at least two program functions.
