    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Many vehicle owners record the fuel efficiency of their vehicles as a way to track the health of the vehicle. If the fuel efficiency of a vehicle suddenly drops, there is probably something wrong with the engine or drive train of the vehicle. In the United States, fuel efficiency for gasoline powered vehicles is calculated as miles per gallon. In most other countries, fuel efficiency is calculated as liters per 100 kilometers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for computing fuel efficiency in miles per gallon is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "mpg = (end âˆ’ start)/gallons\n",
    "\n",
    "where start and end are both odometer values in miles and gallons is a fuel amount in U.S. gallons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for converting miles per gallon to liters per 100 kilometers is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "lp100k = 235.215/mpg\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment\n",
    "Write a Python program that asks the user for three numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A starting odometer value in miles\n",
    "* An ending odometer value in miles\n",
    "* An amount of fuel in gallons\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program must calculate and print fuel efficiency in both miles per gallon and liters per 100 kilometers. Your program must have three functions named as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* main\n",
    "* miles_per_gallon\n",
    "* lp100k_from_mpg\n",
    "\n",
    "All user input and printing must be in the main function. In other words, the miles_per_gallon and lp100k_from_mpg functions must not call the the input or print functions.\n",
